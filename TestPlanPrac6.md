##Test Plan for Prac 6: Jayden Roberts â€“ robe0635
Baggage Handling System for a Major Airport: Denver Airport Baggage Handling System
Any further information on the Denver Airport Baggage Handling System can be found at http://calleam.com/WTPF/?page_id=2086
##Design Analysis
This test plan will be focussed on the baggage handling system for the Denver Airport, the purpose of the baggage handling system is to automate the handling of baggage throughout the entire airport. This system begins at the check-in point, where the bag would be sent throughout the airport to the to the arrivals point with virtually no human interaction, this in turn would reduce flight delays and minimise time spent at the baggage pick up area.
Components of this design
The components of this design can be broken down into three parts, 

* Check-in: baggage is weighed, and then is labelled with its final destination and flight number
* Conveyor system: The conveyor belt system is used to transport the baggage to and from the terminals
 *System Software: This software is used to run the conveyor systems and uses a database to store the baggage information

##Drawbacks of this design

* Misidentification of Baggage: this can cause difficulties in determining where the baggage is located 
* Mechanical Failure:
 *Misdirection of Luggage:

There are many small risks in using this design, with the largest area that would be prone to failure being based at the Check-in area, if there happens to be any errors in the labelling of the bags this would go on to cause major issues with the final destination of the luggage i.e. if there is misreading of the labels at the Check-in point, there is a higher chance of an incorrect reading of the label while the baggage is on the conveyor system causing the bag to be sent to the wrong area or even placed on the wrong flight, thus causing the system to lose baggage and cause flight delays.
